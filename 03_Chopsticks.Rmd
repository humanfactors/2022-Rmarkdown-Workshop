# Our Example: Chopstick Length

What is the optimum length of chopsticks usable by adults? We will be using the "optimum length of chopsticks" data set where researchers set out to determine the optimal length of chopsticks for children and adults. They came up with a measure of how effective a pair of chopsticks performed, called the "Food Pinching Performance." The "Food Pinching Performance" was determined by counting the number of peanuts picked and placed in a cup (PPPC). As this is fake data, assume that the measure represents the weight in grams of peanuts moved.

## Setup

I normally like to specify all my code that "sets things up" in a setup chunk as per below.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # defaults
library(knitr) # for kable function
library(qwraps2) # for in-text means example
library(skimr) # for summary statistics
library(apa) # for t_apa function

# This is just setting up the data
chopstick_data = read.csv("./data/chopstickdata.csv") %>% 
  relocate(Subject, ChopstickLength, FoodPinchingEff) %>% 
  mutate(ChopstickLength = as.factor(ChopstickLength),
         Subject = as.factor(Subject)) %>% 
  arrange(ChopstickLength, Subject)

# And getting our demographics information
demogr = read.csv("./data/demographics.csv")
```
